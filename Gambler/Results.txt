Do you always get the same policy? 
No. The value iterator, though fitting roughly the
same shape, will have different troughs than the
policy iterator.  This can also change based on the
number of trials.  This is because a differing number
of trials may give the entity different goals.


Do the two algorithms run about the same time?
No. The policy learning algorithm is by far faster.
